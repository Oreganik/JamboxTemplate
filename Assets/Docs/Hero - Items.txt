# Jambox Hero: Items


Items are discrete objects in the game that can be picked up and dropped by entities, such as the hero, enemies, and treasure chests.

All items have the following fields:
- Category: This keeps things organized for inventory management, logic, etc. Ultimately, it's optional: you can leave it blank if you only have a few items in the game.
	Examples: Key, Weapon, Potion
- Id: This is a unique ID that is used by internal game logic.
	Examples: security, big_sword, mana
- Name: This is used by the display.
	Examples: Security Card, Big Sword, Mana Juice
