# JAMBOX : HIGH SCORE SCHEMA FILE FOR UNITY
# (c) Oreganik LLC, April 2019
# Author: Ted Brown

# ABOUT THIS FILE
# - This file goes into your Unity project.
# - Place it in the Resources folder.
# - Name it 'schema.txt'
# - It should only have one non-commented, non-empty line: that is the schema definition. 

# CONNECTING WITH PHP
# - Append the schema definition line to the 'schemas.txt' file in your PHP directory so it can properly read data from your game.
# - Note: the PHP schema file supports multiple lines, because it can support multiple games.

# HOW TO CONFIGURE
# - Use one line of tab-delimited values.
# - Don't use spaces or special characters.
# - Make sure your Unity code is filling in the right information.
#
# - (!) The first value must be the game id. (!)

# EXAMPLE
# game_id	uid	date	player_name	score
