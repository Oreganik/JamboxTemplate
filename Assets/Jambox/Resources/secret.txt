# JAMBOX : HIGH SCORE SECRET FILE FOR UNITY
# (c) Oreganik LLC, April 2019
# Author: Ted Brown

# ABOUT THIS FILE
# - This file goes into your Unity project.
# - Place it in the Resources folder.
# - Name it 'secret.txt'
# - It should only have one non-commented, non-empty line: that is the secret definition. 

# CONNECTING WITH PHP
# - Append the schema definition line to the 'secrets.txt' file in your PHP directory so it can properly read data from your game.
# - Note: the PHP schema file supports multiple lines, because it can support multiple games.

# HOW TO CONFIGURE
# - This is one line with two values, separated by a tab: game_id and the secret.
# - Don't use spaces or special characters.

# EXAMPLE
# game_id	itsasecrettoeverybody
