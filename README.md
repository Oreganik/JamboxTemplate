# JamboxTemplate
 
A Unity template for game jams. It's evolved over the years and is not 100% useful all the time (it's sometimes obsolete!), but there's still a lot of solid stuff in here for those with the eyes to see and time to spend.

Contains a lot of helpful code for stuff like:
- Pointer (see what your mouse is pointing at plus interaction interfaces for your classes)
- Input (keyboard + mouse and gamepad)
- Camera Control (shake, fade, movement)
- Popup Dialog (with actions to make it easy to use)
- Uploading data to websites
- Finite State Machine + Transitions
- Simple audio and music player
- Color palette scriptable objects
- Expanded player prefs (store arrays, bools, etc)

Includes example scenes for:
- Camera Shake
- Floating Menus
- High Scores
- Outdoor lighting
- Player Input (keyboard + mouse & gamepad)
- Popup Dialogs
- Post Processing (examples for bloom & ssao)
- Screen Fader
- Strategy Game UI
